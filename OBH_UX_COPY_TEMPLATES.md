# OBH UX / CLI Message Templates (Unified)

## Baseline Proof (Install Verification)
- Title: Baseline Proof
- Body: “Baseline proof establishes a reference point for future comparison and incident analysis.”
- Note: “This is a reference-only artifact. No remediation is performed.”

## Incident Proof (OBH)
- Title: Incident Proof
- Body: “Incident proof preserves time-windowed facts prior to any remediation or optimization.”
- Scope: “OBH performs data-layer capture only: freeze, timeline, export. It never modifies network configuration.”

## Opaque Risk
- Title: Opaque risk
- Body: “Opaque risk indicates that observed behavior lacks minimum referenceable provenance for attribution.”
- Detail: “Referenceable provenance not detected in selected window.”

## Disclaimer (optional, footer)
- “OBH does not provide legal immunity or liability shielding. It provides referenceable evidence artifacts and attribution boundary signaling.”
