# Unified Copy Guide — OBH / fp_proof (Safe, Court-Grade Wording)

## Canonical Tagline
- Proof artifacts, not decisions.

## Canonical Promise (do not weaken)
- We don’t decide what to do. We preserve proof of what happened.

## Opaque Risk (use this exact sentence)
- Opaque risk indicates that observed behavior lacks minimum referenceable provenance for attribution.

## Scope Statement (use this exact sentence)
- OBH performs data-layer capture only: freeze, timeline, export. It never modifies network configuration.

## Guardrails (allowed)
- “referenceable artifacts” / “provenance” / “attribution boundary”
- “observability sufficient / insufficient”
- “undetermined attribution”

## Guardrails (avoid)
- Do NOT mention: NPE / patent / infringement / immunity / liability shield
- Do NOT claim: detection guarantee, root cause, remediation, optimization

## Legal-safe disclaimer sentence
- OBH does not provide legal immunity or liability shielding. It provides referenceable evidence artifacts and attribution boundary signaling.
